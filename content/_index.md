# About

[//]: <> ({{< figure class="avatar" src="img/logo.png" >}})

I'm a conlanger who creates artistic languages that are intended to be more or less naturalistic in nature. I also happen to be a linguist (PhD awarded 2021) and work predominantly in the fields of phonetics and phonology.

I've been constructing languages as a hobby for several years now and here you can find uploads of and links to some of my work. This currently includes some bits and pieces from two of my languages: [Kamya](kamya) and [Xwere Gonom](xwere-gonom). In the long run, however, I hope to publish reference grammars and dictionaries for these and other languages of mine. My GitHub also hosts [Lexifer Plus](https://github.com/keras-saryan/lexifer-plus), a customised version of the word generator [Lexifer Online](https://lingweenie.org/conlang/lexifer-app.html).

If you'd like to say hi, give me feedback on my work or get in touch for any other reason, you can do so by e-mail at `keras[dot]saryan[at]gmail[dot]com` or, if you prefer, I'm also on Reddit as [u/keras_saryan](https://www.reddit.com/user/keras_saryan) and on Discord as `keras_saryan`. You can find me on YouTube as [@keras_saryan](https://www.youtube.com/@keras_saryan) and on Twitch as [keras_saryan](https://www.twitch.tv/keras_saryan), albeit only as a viewer not a creator.
