### About

[//]: <> ({{< figure class="avatar" src="img/logo.png" >}})

I've been constructing languages for several years now and, though I'd never really shared any of my conlanging output in the past, the purpose of this website is to host some of this work for public consumption.

I plan to put material up in a piecemeal fashion for the time being but, in the long run, I hope to publish reference grammars and dictionaries for certain languages of mine. However, at the moment, the only language I've uploaded information on is my current long-term project, Kamya.

If you'd like to say hi, give me feedback on my work or get in touch for any other reason, you can do so by e-mail at ``keras[dot]saryan[at]gmail[dot]com`` or, if you prefer, I'm also on Reddit as [u/keras_saryan](https://www.reddit.com/user/keras_saryan) and Discord at ``keras_saryan#4307``.

### Kamya

As mentioned above, Kamya is my current long-term project. Set in modern-day south-eastern Europe, it is intended to be a (more or less) naturalistic language.

I began Kamya in 2018 and have been working on it on and off ever since. It has gone on to become the most developed language I've worked on to date, both in terms of grammar and vocabulary, as well as also one of the projects I'm more satisfied with (hence the willingness to make material on it available).

The first time information on Kamya was shared publicly was when its "focus suffix" was featured in [Episode 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyU7XsDCIc8&t=122s) of [Artifexian](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeh-pJYRZTBJDXMNZeWSUVA)'s [WLRST](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLduA6tsl3gyjAoPbTEXUlhIlOVFSG7LMs) series (see original document [here](docs/kamya-wlrst-2020.pdf)).

Next, in March 2021, I gave a presentation entitled *The Exponence of Grammatical Number in Kamya* at the [Digital Language Creation Conference](https://conlang.org/language-creation-conference/dlcc-2021/). The slides for this talk can be seen [here](docs/kamya-dlcc-2021.pdf), the clipped video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEINfK5rmO4) and that day's full livestream [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u-bB_gUeM&t=10065s).
