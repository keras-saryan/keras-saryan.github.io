title: "Anderiva"
---

Anderiva [ˌãⁿdɛɾɪˈβa] is a (mostly) head-final language spoken by a people living in a hilly humid subtropical forested area.

The language has a very small phonemic inventory (6 consonants, 3 oral vowels, 3 nasal vowels) but an extremely high degree of allophony (c. 40 consonants, 8 oral vowels, 6 nasal vowels). Nouns fall into one of four classes (= genders) and, though most adnominal modifiers are preposed, definite articles (homophonous with third-person pronouns) and demonstratives are postposed. Numerals, quantifiers and the indefinite article obligatorily take a suffixed classifier according to the modified/referent noun. Anderiva exhibits both clause chaining and switch reference in which medial verbs are conjugated only for same/different subject and simultaneity/sequentiality; final verbs are conjugated for person/number, tense/aspect and can be followed by various modal/evidential particles.

In October 2025, I gave a presentation entitled *Kut bero mi...* at [Kopikon II](https://kopikon.com/kopikon2/) in which I used an original short story to showcase certain various of the language (slides [here](https://keras-saryan.github.io/kopikon-ii/), the clipped video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXeZs-ofl4I) and the full livestream [here](https://www.youtube.com/live/Vmyr10xHv3A?si=EkzrLEfhXemJjQFJ&t=3174)).
