      <description>Kamya Kamya is my current long-term project. Set in modern-day south-eastern Europe, it is intended to be a (more or less) naturalistic and, more importantly, coherent language.
I began Kamya in 2018 and have been working on it on and off ever since. It has gone on to become the most developed language I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on to date, both in terms of grammar and vocabulary. It&amp;rsquo;s also one of the projects I&amp;rsquo;m more satisfied with, hence my willingness to make material on it available.</description>
