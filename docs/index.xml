      <description>Kamya Kamya is my current long-term project. Set in modern-day south-eastern Europe, it is intended to be a (more or less) naturalistic and, more importantly, coherent language.
I began Kamya in 2018 and have been working on it on and off ever since. It has gone on to become the most developed language I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on to date, both in terms of grammar and vocabulary. It&amp;rsquo;s also one of the projects I&amp;rsquo;m more satisfied with, hence my willingness to make material on it available.</description>

      <description>Xwere Gonom Xwere Gonom [ˈxʷɛɾɛ kɔˈnɔ̃] is a recent – begun October 2022 – language spoken by the Łiined Gonom [ɬiːˈnɛt̪ kɔˈnɔ̃], a riverine people living in an area with a tropical climate and a cycle of wet/dry seasons. Their culture has a traditional emphasis on fishing and horticulture, with only a relatively limited amount of animal husbandry.
The language is strongly head-initial, exhibiting a basic VSO constituent order, prepositions and postposed adnominal modifiers.</description>
