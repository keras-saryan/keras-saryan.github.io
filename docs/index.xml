      <description>Kamya Kamya is an a priori language set in modern-day south-eastern Europe. I began Kamya in 2018 and have been working on it on and off ever since. It has become the most developed language I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on to date, both in terms of grammar and vocabulary.&#xA;The first time information on Kamya was shared publicly was in November 2020 when its &amp;ldquo;focus suffix&amp;rdquo; was featured in Episode 4 of Artifexian&amp;rsquo;s WLRST series (see original document here).</description>

      <description>Xwere Gonom Xwere Gonom [ˈxʷɛɾɛ kɔˈnɔ̃] – begun October 2022 – is a language spoken by the Łiined Gonom [ɬiːˈnɛt̪ kɔˈnɔ̃], a riverine people living in an area with a tropical climate and a cycle of wet/dry seasons. Their culture has a traditional emphasis on fishing and horticulture, with only a relatively limited amount of animal husbandry.&#xA;The language is strongly head-initial, exhibiting a basic VSO constituent order, prepositions and postposed adnominal modifiers.</description>
