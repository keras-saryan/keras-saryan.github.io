    "section": "",
    "text": "Anderiva [ˌãⁿdɛɾɪˈβa] is a (mostly) head-final language spoken by a people living in a hilly humid subtropical forested area.\nThe language has a very small phonemic inventory (6 consonants, 3 oral vowels, 3 nasal vowels) but an extremely high degree of allophony (c. 40 consonants, 8 oral vowels, 6 nasal vowels). Nouns fall into one of four classes (= genders) and, though most adnominal modifiers are preposed, definite articles (homophonous with third-person pronouns) and demonstratives are postposed. Numerals, quantifiers and the indefinite article obligatorily take a suffixed classifier whose form is dependent on the modified/referent noun. Anderiva exhibits both clause chaining and switch reference in which medial verbs are conjugated only for same/different subject and simultaneity/sequentiality; final verbs are conjugated for person/number, tense/aspect and can be followed by various modal/evidential particles."
