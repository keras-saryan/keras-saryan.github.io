    "text": "Xwere Gonom [ˈxʷɛɾɛ kɔˈnɔ̃] – begun October 2022 – is a language spoken by the Łiined Gonom [ɬiːˈnɛt̪ kɔˈnɔ̃], a riverine people living in an area with a tropical climate and a cycle of wet/dry seasons. Their culture has a traditional emphasis on fishing and horticulture, with only a relatively limited amount of animal husbandry.\nThe language is strongly head-initial, exhibiting a basic VSO constituent order, prepositions and postposed adnominal modifiers. It possesses a restrained three-case system which exhibits animacy-based differential argument marking for both subjects and objects. Verbs agree with their absolutive argument in person and number. There are a total of 11 aspects/moods, which are conflated into a single morphological category, but no proper morphological tense or voice. Grammatical number is a salient morphological category only for animate referents. Pronouns and verbal agreement distinguish clusivity in the first person and consanguinity in the first person inclusive and second person; in the third person, there is a distinction between human, other animates and inanimate.\nThe consonant phoneme inventory includes a two-way voiceless–glottalised contrast for bilabial and velar plosives but a three-way voiceless–glottalised–aspirated contrast for dental/alveolar and retroflex plosives and affricates. The vowel phoneme inventory distinguishes four broad monophthongal qualities, all of which come in short–long pairs; there are also various diphthongs; there is a further oral–nasal contrast for all monophthongs and diphthongs. Stress is weight sensitive and anchored towards the right edge of the word: a final syllable is stressed if it is heavy (i.e. contains a diphthong, long vowel, nasal vowel or coda consonant), otherwise stress is penultimate."

    "text": "Kamya [ˈkamja] is an a priori language set in modern-day south-eastern Europe. I began Kamya in 2018 and have been working on it on and off ever since. It has become the most developed language I’ve worked on to date, both in terms of grammar and vocabulary.\nThe language has a basic SVO constituent order but is strongly head-final in noun phrases; it notably lacks adpositions. It has eight core cases and its alignment is predominantly nominative–accusative with a dab of fluid-S as the dative can be used to express non-volitional subjects. Verbs agree with their subjects in number regardless of whether that is made explicit on the subject itself; they also inflect for various combinations of tense, mood and voice. Kamya has a fairly standard phonological system by European standards, though stress is antepenultimate by default, which is rather uncommon cross-linguistically."

You can read the document I submitted here, which includes some notes on points of grammar found in the text.\nIn March 2021, I gave a presentation entitled The exponence of grammatical number in Kamya at the Digital Language Creation Conference. The slides for this talk can be seen here, the clipped video here and the full livestream here.\nIn 2022, I wrote an article called Topics in adjectival meaning in Kamya which was published in the fifth issue of r/conlangs’ journal Segments on the semantic ranges of nine adjectives. The entire issue can be accessed here and the individual article here.\nIn 2025, I used Kamya in Jessie’s ring of Let’s Have A Relay (torch, mistakes and all, here)."

    "text": "Anderiva [ˌãⁿdɛɾɪˈβa] is a (mostly) head-final language spoken by a people living in a hilly humid subtropical forested area.\nThe language has a very small phonemic inventory (6 consonants, 3 oral vowels, 3 nasal vowels) but an extremely high degree of allophony (c. 40 consonants, 8 oral vowels, 6 nasal vowels). Nouns fall into one of four classes (= genders) and, though most adnominal modifiers are preposed, definite articles (homophonous with third-person pronouns) and demonstratives are postposed. Numerals, quantifiers and the indefinite article obligatorily take a suffixed classifier according to the modified/referent noun. Anderiva exhibits both clause chaining and switch reference in which medial verbs are conjugated only for same/different subject and simultaneity/sequentiality; final verbs are conjugated for person/number, tense/aspect and can be followed by various modal/evidential particles."

    "text": "Sar̃ifa [ˈsaɾɪɸə] is a head-final language with a basic SOV constituent order. Nouns have a singular–paucal–plural number distinction; the plural is formed in various lexically-determined ways with the paucal being built off the plural, though sometimes with additional changes. Verbs are conjugated for person/number, tense/aspect, mood and voice. Verb stems and person markers both possess short and long forms and it is the combination of these short and long forms that expresses tense/aspect. Sar̃ifa also makes copious use of converbs and applicatives. The phonemic inventory includes ejectives and implosive /ɓ/ as well as labialised velars and glottals. There are various phonological processes of assimilation, dissimilation and reduction, some of which are still fully predictable whereas others have become lexicalised to some degree."
